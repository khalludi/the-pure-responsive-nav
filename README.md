# Responsive Navbar
I followed a tutorial to create a responsive navbar using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To run, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred browser. As you resize the window to a phone screen, the navigation pages automatically hide behind a menu button. Links to tutorial and image are below.
